I freakin' love [Transformer Circuits](https://transformer-circuits.pub/) thread. Their research on mechanistic interpretability of transformer models is extremely interesting, to say the least, and hopefully over the long-term, useful for building safe and aligned AI systems.

As much as I adore these blog posts, they can also be very intimidating to dive deep into, if you're just a beginner in mechanistic interpretability and just getting started in learning about this field. Some of the posts can be as long as 50+ pages long, and the content is quite heavy on math. I myself have struggled in reading through the papers and trying to understand every bit of information they are trying to offer. This is why I created this blog for fellow learners, who might have 

In this blog post I focus on the first blog post of the thread, called [A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html). I try to compress the most important ideas of the post in 15 minutes of reading and video snippets.


## Prerequisites
I try to keep the prerequisites for this paper to a minimum for this post but there are a few concepts that are helpful for reading through the article.

**Linear transformations:** 

## Residual stream
Residual stream of a transformer is the "central memory" of a transformer. All of the other components of a transformer, attention heads, feed-forward network and layer norms, interact with it by reading data from it, and writing back to it after performing a computation.


## Attention-only Transformers
A transformer is a device that is used to transfer electrical energy from one circuit to another through electromagnetic induction. It consists of two coils of wire, known as the primary and secondary coils, that are wound around a common core. When an alternating current is passed through the primary coil, it creates a changing magnetic field that induces a voltage in the secondary coil. This voltage can then be used to power a load connected to the secondary coil.

## Boilerplate
In this article, we have covered the basics of transformer circuits. We have looked at how transformers work, the different types of transformers that are available, and some of the key equations that are used to describe their behavior. Transformers are an essential component of many electrical systems and are used in a wide range of applications. By understanding the principles of transformer circuits, you can gain a better understanding of how electrical systems work and how they can be optimized for different applications.
